# Log-Analysis-With-Window-s-Event-Viewer

I enabled permissions to allow me to see various Log In Events from other Users on my PC (or if someone just typed randomly on my PC since I am the only one that uses it).
I also created a test user for this purpose and registered their log-ins and researched the event IDs along with the general details of the report like logon type, user, etc. 

Further Plans: 
I plan on doing this again in linux and will update when I do. I also would like to make it easier to read to I might build a program for that and will update if I do.
