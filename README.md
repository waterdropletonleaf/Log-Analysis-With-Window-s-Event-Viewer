# Log-Analysis-With-Window-s-Event-Viewer

I enabled permissions to allow me to see various Log In Events from other Users on my PC (or if someone just typed randomly on my PC since I am the only one that uses it).
I also created a test user for this purpose and registered their log-ins and researched the event IDs along with the general details of the report like logon type, user, etc.
